#**Satellite Image Classification Using Lightweight CNN Architectures**

This project presents optimized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures designed for efficient and accurate classification of satellite images, particularly suited for deployment in real-time and low-resource environments like drones or edge computing platforms.

**ðŸš€ Features**
Two lightweight CNN models:

Channel Separated CNN (CS-CNN)

Channel Separated CNN with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE-CS-CNN)

High classification accuracy (~94%) with minimal computational cost.

Efficient use of parameters (~1.25M vs. 1.87M in standard CNNs).

Adaptable to multispectral and derived indices (e.g., NDVI, NDBI).

Compatible with small input image sizes (64x64x3).

**ðŸ›  Technologies Used**
Python 3.12

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy, Pandas


Scikit-learn (for preprocessing and evaluation)
